### Hello there ðŸ‘‹


**AlphOmart/AlphOmart** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying at school 42, learning dev, in a general way, but with an emphasis on c.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with everything if you have times, and tips.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me questions about funny or weird facts or about my code. (even if it's actually the same thing ðŸ™„).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: On discord, my tag is: Alphom#7119.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Dany, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0X5A6aURms
